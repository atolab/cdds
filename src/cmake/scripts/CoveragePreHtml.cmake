# This script assumes that it is called before all tests are run and gcov results are available.
# It can be used to setup the environment needed to get proper HTML coverage results.
#
# Example usage:
# $ cmake -DCOVERAGE_SETTINGS=<cham bld>/CoverageSettings.cmake -P <cham src>/cmake/scripts/CoveragePreHtml.cmake
# $ ctest -T test
# $ ctest -T coverage
# $ ctest -DCOVERAGE_SETTINGS=<cham bld>/CoverageSettings.cmake -P <cham src>/cmake/scripts/CoveragePostHtml.cmake
# If you start the scripts while in <cham bld> then you don't have to provide the COVERAGE_SETTINGS file.
