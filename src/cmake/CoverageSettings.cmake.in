# TODO: Make this a list instead of separate variables when more directories
#       need to be excluded. Currently there's actually only one directory to
#       be excluded, but when the test(s) are moved, more directories will be
#       added. I just added two directories to indicate how the coverage
#       generators handle multiple exclusion directories.

# Do not include the various test directories.
