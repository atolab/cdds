Getting Started Guide
#####################

This is the getting started guide.

It starts with a short :ref:`introduction <Introduction>` into DDS and
then continues with the :ref:`installation <Installation>` of VortexDDS.

The following chapters are examples of increasing complexity.

The :ref:`Hello World <HelloWorld>` handles events (like
detecting new data) and the difference between reliable and best effort
communication.

The :ref:`Hello Instance World <HelloInstanceWorld>` deals with keys to
identify data, which means samples and instances in DDS terms. It also
deals with the way states of data can change and how this is related to
these samples and instances.
