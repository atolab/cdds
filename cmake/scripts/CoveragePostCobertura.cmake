# This script assumes that all test have been run and gcov results are available.
# It will generate the Cobertura output from the gcov results.
#
# Example usage:
# $ cmake -DCOVERAGE_SETTINGS=<cham bld>/CoverageSettings.cmake -P <cham src>/cmake/scripts/CoveragePreCobertura.cmake
# $ ctest -T test
# $ ctest -T coverage
# $ ctest -DCOVERAGE_SETTINGS=<cham bld>/CoverageSettings.cmake -P <cham src>/cmake/scripts/CoveragePostCobertura.cmake
# If you start the scripts while in <cham bld> then you don't have to provide the COVERAGE_SETTINGS file.
